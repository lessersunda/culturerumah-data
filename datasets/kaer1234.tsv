For example, when we hunt, we are not allowed to touch green leafs because then the dogs will smell less. When people ask where we go we should not say we go hunting or fishing. Instead we say menik yaso 'pigi suangi', 'go to the ghosts'. Otherwise we will not catch anything. This applies to fishing and hunting.	nan	nan	nan

Those who die because of an accident, were put in a tree and left for 6 days, lying on their side. Those who die of age are kept at home lying on their back, wrapped in or accompanied by a kain watola (silk cloth) if they possess such. (If they have no silk cloth, the family has to buy it with a moko or gong.) In the past, the coffin of these bodies was made in the shape of a boat, e.g. from the stem of a kapok tree, because Soyang weling is accessed by boat. At the burial place, there are 3 priests who hold a thin bamboo rope. They call out e' kupang mamu e dulgus axorang (meaning unknown), then ipang walis sei e yedo 'dead spirits are you ready or not?', and when the people attending answer Sei! 'ready' the body is put in its grave. When people died of lepra, the body was encaged in the bark of a pinang tree, then packaged with bamboo and burried at a remote place where people would never pass by. Today these rituals have changed. Dead people are kept at home in a wooden coffin for 1 or 2 days, then burried after a church service. After 40 days there is a party with food. 	nan	nan	nan
