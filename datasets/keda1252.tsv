Uye Lewun is a woman, and her descendants are Ome Suri (female) and Buya Suri (male). These two children then have children and these become the 44 kampongs. The specific family tree goes like this from the very beginning: Uye Lewun (female; the mountain was named after her) has a son Raya Uyo, he has 4 children, Pitang Raya > Kedang, Mau Raya > Timor (where there are Mau clans), Ama Raya > Adonara, Ua Raya > Pantar Alor. From Pitang Raya it goes like this: he has a child Pulo Pitang, he has two children Ome Suri and Buya Suri, and they got children, and these are the Kedang people. This is why they are subdistricts (kecamatan) Ome Suri and Buya Suri. The mountain was not there at first, but ancestors came with a ship that got stuck on a rock, and a bird sat on top of the pole of the boat and was shot, one wing broke. It became a rock, this is why the mountain looks like a bird with one spread wing and one broken wing. Kedang people are said to come from Sina Puel Sana Matang.
